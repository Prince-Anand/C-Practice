#include <stdio.h> // Include the standard input-output header file, which contains functions like printf() and scanf().
// its like importing math.py for maths function in python

int main() // The main function where the execution of the program begins
{
    printf("Hello World"); // printf() is a function which is already coded in c library stdio.h
    return 0;              // Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program without any error.
}

// for printing output in terminal
// move to folder of the code file in the directory with cd commands
// write 1st -> gcc file.c
// then, write 2nd line -> .\a.exe
